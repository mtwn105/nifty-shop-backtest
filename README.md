# Nifty Shop Backtesting

This project provides a comprehensive backtest for the "Nifty Shop" trading strategy on the Nifty 50 index, allowing for detailed performance analysis and strategy refinement.

## Strategy: Nifty Shop

The "Nifty Shop" strategy is a mean-reversion approach designed for beginners, focusing on systematically buying dips in Nifty 50 stocks.

### Entry Rules (checked daily at 3:20 PM)

- **Scan for Dips:** Identify the top five Nifty 50 stocks that are trading the furthest below their 20-day moving average (20 SMA).
- **Buy New Positions:** From this list, the script can buy up to a configurable number of new stocks (default is 1) that are not already in the portfolio.
- **Averaging Down:** If all top fallers are already held, the script can "average down" on an existing position if its price has dropped by a specified percentage (e.g., 3%) from the last purchase price. It prioritizes the one with the biggest current drop.

### Exit Rules (checked daily at 3:20 PM)

- **Check for Gains:** The script scans the portfolio for any stock trading above a specified profit target (e.g., 5%) from its average purchase price.
- **Sell for Profit:** If multiple stocks meet the profit criteria, the script sells only one per dayâ€”the one with the highest percentage gain.

### Capital Allocation

The script supports two sizing models:

- **Fixed Amount:** A constant, predefined amount is invested in each trade.
- **Dynamic Amount:** A percentage of the total current portfolio value is invested in each trade (e.g., 1/40th of the portfolio).

## How to Use

### 1. Installation

Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Before running the backtest, you can customize the strategy parameters in the `nifty_shop_backtest_v4.py` script under the **MASTER CONFIGURATION & STRATEGY RULES** section.

Key parameters you can change:

- `START_DATE` / `END_DATE`: The period for the backtest.
- `INITIAL_CAPITAL`: The starting amount for the simulation.
- `PROFIT_TARGET_PERCENT`: The gain required to trigger a sell.
- `AVERAGING_TRIGGER_PERCENT`: The loss required to trigger an average-down buy.
- `MAX_NEW_BUYS_PER_DAY`: Limits how many new stocks can be bought in a single day.
- `TRADE_AMOUNT_FIXED` / `DYNAMIC_SIZING_DIVISOR`: Controls the trade size for the two models.
- `ENABLE_SIP`: Set to `True` to simulate regular monthly investments.
- `RUN_FIXED_SIZING_TEST` / `RUN_DYNAMIC_SIZING_TEST`: Booleans to control which backtesting models to run.

### 3. Execution

Run the backtest from your terminal:

```bash
python nifty_shop_backtest_v4.py
```

## Understanding the Backtest Script

The `nifty_shop_backtest_v4.py` script is organized into four main parts:

1.  **Configuration & Data Fetching:**

    - Sets all strategy rules, dates, and capital settings.
    - Loads historical Nifty 50 constituents from `nifty50.csv` to ensure the backtest uses the correct stocks for any given date.
    - Downloads all required historical price data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

2.  **Backtesting Engine (`run_backtest` function):**

    - This is the core of the simulation. It iterates through each day in the specified date range.
    - On each day, it processes SIP injections, checks for sell signals based on profit targets, and then checks for buy signals based on the 20 SMA deviation.
    - It meticulously logs every transaction (buy, sell, average, SIP) and calculates the portfolio's total value daily.
    - It handles portfolio management, including cash, holdings, and calculating average costs.

3.  **Metrics Calculation & Reporting:**

    - After the simulation loop, this section calculates a wide array of performance metrics.
    - **Returns Analysis:** CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) and XIRR (for cash-flow-adjusted returns).
    - **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Sharpe Ratio (returns vs. volatility) and Sortino Ratio (returns vs. downside volatility).
    - **Risk Metrics:** Maximum Drawdown (largest peak-to-trough drop) and Calmar Ratio (CAGR vs. Max Drawdown).
    - **Market Comparison:** Alpha (outperformance vs. benchmark) and Beta (volatility relative to the benchmark).
    - The results are printed to the console in a structured format.

4.  **Plotting:**
    - Generates a comparative equity curve chart using `matplotlib`.
    - This visualizes the growth of the strategy's portfolio value against the NIFTYBEES index, providing an intuitive understanding of its performance over time.

## Backtest Output Explained

The script provides a rich set of outputs to help you analyze the strategy's performance:

- **Console Report:**
  - **Detailed Strategy Metrics:** The main table showing CAGR, XIRR, Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, etc.
  - **Quarterly Trade Grid:** A pivot table showing the number of buys and sells in each quarter, helping to identify periods of high/low activity.
  - **Top Trades Analysis:** Lists of the top 5 trades based on the number of averaging events and profitability (both by percentage and absolute amount).
  - **Recent Activity:** The last 10 transactions and the last 10 closed trades are displayed for a recent snapshot.
  - **Final Holdings:** A summary of all stocks held in the portfolio at the end of the backtest period.
- **CSV File:**
  - `trade_log.csv`: A detailed CSV file is generated, containing a timestamped record of every single transaction made during the backtest. This is useful for in-depth, external analysis.
- **Chart:**
  - **Equity Curve Plot:** A PNG window will pop up showing the strategy's performance graph.
